# AI_TASKFORCE_ASSIGNMENT
Only for recruitment process

- Image is generated using DALL-E
- watermark is already there, just modify a few condition statement
- added SAM2 (segment anything model 2) for segmenting object and removing background based on segment mask. Library used ultralytics

- URL for stream (expired after 72 hours): https://4d66f36da68c6f94c6.gradio.live/

Note: I sit for 12 hours working on this code and trying to integrate 2 advanced model but failed. Those model are finegrain and GroundingDino+SAM (both for interactive prompt input). 

- Finegrain link: https://huggingface.co/finegrain/finegrain-box-segmenter

- GroundingDINO + SAM link:https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-Segment-Anything

Failed integration are due to unavailable API and huge model size.
